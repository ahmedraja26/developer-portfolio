    "During the day I work as a junior software developer at a local agency and in the evening I work on building my skills and utilize the time to build my own products. I spent my leisure hours watching sports and gaming. Right now I'm also trying my hand at improving my front end development by learning new stacks such as react. I love to learn and explore new arenas.",
